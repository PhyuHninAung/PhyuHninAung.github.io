        <li><h2>Who am I?</h2></li>
            <p>Hi! My name is Phyu Hnin Aung and you can call me 'Phyu'. During my poly days, most of my friends remembered my name as the
            sound of gun shooting as it kinda sounds like 'phyuuu phyuuu phyuuu', they said. Jokes aside, you can call me Mabel too. :) 
            </p>
            <p>I am from Myanmar aka Burma formerly. I came to Singapore in 2010 for further studies and graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic with 
            mechatronic engineering in 2013. I worked full time and studied part time degree (BIS & Web Com) at Murdoch University.
            </p>
        <li><h2>Past jobs</h2></li>
            <p>Before I started studying as a full time postgraduate student, I worked as a software requirements engineer
            for a few years in Japanese car audio company. I do not have any working experience in programming as the job was to study product 
            requirements and create specification documents for the software developers.</p>
        <li><h2>Hobbies</h2></li>
            <p>I do not have any particular hobby but I like to swim from time to time and spend my leisure watching anime and korean
            variety shows.</p>
        <li><h2>Interests</h2></li>
            <p>One of the interests that I developed recently is crocheting. I find it cute and amazing, but may be I will try it out after 
            finishing the school.</p>
